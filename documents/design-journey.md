# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Design Planning

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.
